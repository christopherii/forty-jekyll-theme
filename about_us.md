### Jeremy Nixon
Jeremy's identity was identitilessness, until identitilessness realized that it, itself, had become an identity. And so it destroyed itself by creating an identity, and then looped and loops, recursively, destroying identity to reaffirm identitilessness, and destroying identitilessness to reaffirm identitilessnes.

In a bid to become uncompressible, Jeremy maximized his worldview for valuable self-variance. After re-modeling and so re-compressing himself, flagging in uncompressibility, he created and internalized novel conceptual schemes, creating new variance and re-uncompressing himself, just to model himself and become compressed and uninteresting once more. He's currently looking to discover, create and internalize new and valuable modes of thinking.

### Christopher Read
Say that we are all sculptors of self. Do we not, in clear moments, feel those bloodless abstractions, those pale imitations of life, those constructions of mind, that self-disembodied head and dead bone, which ground out _nowhere_. You say you are such-and-such a person, as if even our greatest archaeologists could find you!

But more seriously, how to become what you are is one difficult instance of a high-dimensional problem — the highest or second highest, and good fodder. Like all problems, it can be cast as an abstract structure. These structures operate according to laws. To know the laws is to answer the only real, at-bottom question: solving the problem of problems. Christopher is constructing a solution.
