We’re building a structure for knowledge about creativity. Decomposing creativity into its forms, techniques, and fundamental elements, and then executing and optimizing over that decomposition.

<h3>Creating a Creativity Framework</h3>

One fascinating experience is to carefully watch a brilliant mind generate creative ideas, and then to 1. through seeing patterns and similarities among the generated ideas, categorize them and 2. create categories for the thought processes or mental motions that generated the ideas.

Quality examples of mental motions include:  
- Identify the generator of the thought or intuition - why did this person think that thought?  
- Abstract & Generalization - What is the most general form of this - idea?   
- Skeptical - in what ways is this untrue, unlikely, wrong or broken?
- Decompose - Ex., Break the concept down into its sub-concepts, break a situation into sub-cases, or add nuance through introducing a conditional.  
- Relatedness / Transfer / Cognitive Fit with something else  
- Prediction / Anticipation of outcome  
- ‘Control’ - How do I get control over the structure / situation at hand?  
- Understand - Explain a part of the system that I don’t know about, resulting from a failed prediction or a sparse decomposition that I want filled  
- Distinction (or introduce conditional)  
- Actions Taken as a Result  
- Assumption Questioning  
    * Ontology / Paradigm Questioning (There’s an interconnected memeplex of assumptions)
    * Breakdown of Categories (seeing their brokenness, oneness, or decomposition)


We can describe a thinking style as having a prediliction towards particular mental motions. That distribution over patterns of thought categories creates a space of thinking styles that can be navigated, explored, and expanded.
