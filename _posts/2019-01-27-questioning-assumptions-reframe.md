Our mind implicitly assumes a solution space. This solution space may not be optimal. We can reframe the solution space by explicitly playing with assumptions. Assumptions like:


__Reframe / Question Assumptions__  
    - Constraints  
        - Create resource constraints (time, attention, money, assumptions, etc.)  
        - Create resource excess (time, attention, money, etc.)  
        - Eliminating options  
        	- Independent plans  
        - What are the upstream constraints in the system?  
        - Define boundaries of solution spaces better  
            - Find upstream constraints  
    - Apply different modes of processing  
        - What would a supervillain do? (Prompt framing) / Supervillain mode  
        - Emotional - Get into emotional state and generate ideas  
            - Anger  
            - Arousal  
            - Gratefulness  
            - Adoration  
            - Frustration  
            - Excitement  
        - Types of Thinker - What would I generate if I was a:  
            - Mathematician  
            - Technologist  
            - Computer Scientist  
            - Philosopher  
            - Psychologist  
            - Economist  
        - find inspiration in other areas:  
            - math  
            - mythology  
            - writings about principles  
            - Physics  
            - Etc  
        - Environmental  
            - Work in a cluttered environment  
        - Game Lenses, list of generic lenses  
        - Asking what would Hufflepuff / Gryffindor / me would do  
        - Asking what a friend would do  
        - Predicting what someone will say and   
            - Then asking them, for interesting feedback  
    - What? / Why? / How?
